# SuiPump-Token-Market
This project was prepared for our team's first participation in a Hackathon. There are still many areas that need improvement, and we sincerely welcome your feedback and suggestions!

## Project Workflow:

The user connects their wallet -> begins creating a token -> enters information and uploads an avatar -> initiates token creation -> upon completion, the page automatically redirects to the token trading information page -> the user can then buy or sell the token.

## PS:

The demo project is deployed on Walrus Site: https://6c3c7hcsfwh4fwwouhopdyweeaybmat1gynncu1btrvxiefc2n.walrus.site/. User-uploaded avatars are also stored on my server's Walrus service via an API. Since both the frontend and backend were developed by myself, there are currently issues with network latency during API communication and bugs with wallet connections. If you encounter problems, please try refreshing the page multiple times. You can also view the demo video. Thank you all for your support!
